# Why

Evertime I tried to start a company or a project, I need an email to
associate email to us. Setting up a full mail suite requires time,
effort and commitment. I just need a very easy and intuitive way with a
few click to give me ability of receiving email to my domain.

On the other hands, it's great to have email tailor to our name or our
personal identity instead of trying to be creative for an email address
that is still available on public service like gmail.

Using your own domain also give you a short and easy to remember email
address.

I built hanami.run so that everyone can have an email address with their
own domain name

But email is hard, run your own mail server isn't a quick job. We can
use public and expensive service like GSuite and we still have to deal
with their bloated UI given they have to support too many different use
cases and their target at enteprise customer.

I build hanami to give you an easy solution, just a few click and within
seconds you should be able to see email hit your domains.

# What

At our core, Hanami is an email forwarding service. We aim to have
better visibility into what happen with your emails, why emails won't
deliver, fast delivery time and building workflow around email with
webhook.

Example our [dev channel](https://hanami.run/channel/dev) is built with
our API.

On top of that, we know that receiving email is half of problem, people
want to send out email from their own domain too, so we also offer SMTP
Services.

# The future

At the same time, we like to make email more fun. We are commited to
build tools that help you process email easily. Your banks don't have an
API to help you build a real-time activity tracker? Just use email.

Want to have comment for a static site? Just send an email.

Stay tune when we build and open source those components.

With that being said, let's give [hanami](https://hanami.run) a try to
have a unique email powered by your very own domain.
