# Why

Email should be unique, just like your name. At hanami we hope to enable eveyryone ability to have an email address with their own domain name.

But email is hard. Getting your email to delivery reliably and figting with
spam aren' in easy job. We build hanami so you don't have to.

# What

At our core, Hanami is an email forwarding service. We aim to have
better visibility into what happen with your emails, why emails won't
deliver, have fast delivery time.

On top of that, we know that receiving email is half of problem, we want
to send out email so we also offer SMTP service.

# The future

At the same time, we like to make email more fun. We are commited to
build tools that help you process email easily. Your banks don't have an
API to help you build a real-time activity tracker? Just use email

Want to have comment for a static site? Just send an email.

Stay tune when we build and open source those components

With that being said, let's give [hanami](https://hanami.run) a try to
have a unique email power by your very own domain.
