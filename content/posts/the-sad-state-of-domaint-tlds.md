# Launch

I recently launch an email forwarding service. Naming is hard. My life has been affected by Japanese culture and I like flower a lot. I like watchin flowers flews in the air and think that email forwarding has a similar illussion. So I name the service Hanami. Which is an act of watching the flower.

But both of hanami.com or hanami.co   hanami.io are unvailable. I ended up with hanami.run.

Once running this service and getting a few customers and email started to flower in. Currently we have more than 20 customers using the services.

# Spam on tlds

One particular thing is the email: almost all spam email come from non .com TLD. Especial .cam, work, .tech, .xyz and myself .run.

When looking at https://www.spamhaus.org/statistics/tlds/

.run has an amoun

The price of those domain name are just too cheap becuase they usually have promotion at $1 on first year. And spam usually will be detected very quickly and they don't care about their domain anymore. Imagine me, a small guys, have to accept and process about 1000 spam emails per day from those domains. The system that filter our spam, check dns blacklist has to be kicked in.

My temporary solution is I ban all these sensitive domain like .cam, .work..

But at the same time, my service are run on a non traditional TLD: .run. So isn't this a bad act. I think I will figured out a way to deal with spam TLD eventually and have a more effective way to deal with spam instead

I know a few IT guys, they have come to the same conclusion and they ended up ban a few one entirely such as .xyz or .cam or .work.

I wish the registra will increase price of domain, and force some penalty such as if you bough the domain and bailt out earlier you have to pay some penalty fee.




I would advise everyone who started a new website and
